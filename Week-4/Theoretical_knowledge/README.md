# Theoretical Knowledge

## 1. Threat Hunting Methodologies
- Learned the difference between proactive threat hunting and reactive incident response.
- Understood how hypothesis-driven hunting helps identify attacker behavior early.
- Learned how attacker techniques like misuse of valid accounts can be detected through logs.
- Gained understanding of using multiple data sources such as EDR logs, network traffic, and threat intelligence.

## 2. Advanced SOAR Automation
- Learned the purpose of SOAR in automating SOC workflows.
- Understood the roles of orchestration, automation, and response in incident handling.
- Learned how playbooks are used for incidents such as phishing and malware.
- Gained understanding of how automation reduces response time and analyst workload.

## 3. Post-Incident Analysis and Continuous Improvement
- Learned the importance of post-incident analysis after a security event.
- Understood how Root Cause Analysis helps identify the main cause of incidents.
- Learned how lessons learned improve future detection and response.
- Gained understanding of SOC metrics like MTTD and MTTR.

## 4. Adversary Emulation Techniques
- Learned how adversary emulation simulates real attacker behavior.
- Understood how techniques like phishing and remote exploitation are tested.
- Learned how emulation helps evaluate SOC detection capabilities.
- Gained understanding of Red Team and Blue Team collaboration.

## 5. Security Metrics and Executive Reporting
- Learned why security metrics are important for measuring SOC performance.
- Understood metrics such as dwell time and false positive rate.
- Learned how incident details are summarized for non-technical stakeholders.
- Gained understanding of how metrics support continuous SOC improvement.
