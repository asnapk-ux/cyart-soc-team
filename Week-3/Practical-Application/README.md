# Practical Application

## 2. Threat Intelligence Integration
- Used AlienVault OTX to search and validate a mock malicious IP address (192.168.1.100).
- Identified that the IP was associated with a known Meterpreter Command-and-Control pulse.
- Integrated threat intelligence context while analyzing alerts in Wazuh.
- Documented alert enrichment details including IP reputation and threat notes.
- Performed basic threat hunting in Wazuh logs focusing on MITRE ATT&CK technique T1078 (Valid Accounts).
- Used authentication-related queries to check for non-system user activity.

---

## 3. Incident Escalation Practice
- Created a high-priority incident case in TheHive for a simulated unauthorized access alert.
- Assigned severity and classification based on the nature of the incident.
- Escalated the case from Tier 1 to Tier 2 with a detailed summary.
- Drafted a SITREP (Situation Report) describing the incident timeline, impact, and actions taken.
- Practiced documenting escalation steps clearly for higher-level analysts and stakeholders.

---

## 4. Alert Triage with Threat Intelligence
- Analyzed a mock high-priority alert related to suspicious PowerShell execution in Wazuh.
- Reviewed alert details such as source IP, description, and priority.
- Validated the alert’s IP using external threat intelligence sources.
- Cross-referenced indicators with AlienVault OTX and VirusTotal to assess maliciousness.
- Documented triage results, alert status, and investigation findings.

## Overall Practical Learning
- Gained hands-on experience correlating alerts with threat intelligence.
- Improved understanding of SOC alert triage and escalation workflows.
- Learned how practical SOC tools are used together during investigation and response.
