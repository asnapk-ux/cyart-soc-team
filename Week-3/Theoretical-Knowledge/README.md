# Theoretical Knowledge

## 1. Advanced Log Analysis
- Learned how correlating logs from multiple sources helps identify attack patterns.
- Understood how failed login events combined with network activity can indicate intrusions.
- Learned the purpose of anomaly detection in identifying unusual user behavior.
- Gained understanding of log enrichment and how adding context reduces false positives.

---

## 2. Threat Intelligence Integration
- Learned the different types of threat intelligence such as IOCs and TTPs.
- Understood how threat feeds are used to enrich SIEM alerts automatically.
- Learned how malicious IPs and domains are linked to known threat campaigns.
- Gained knowledge of using threat intelligence for proactive threat hunting.
- Understood the importance of MITRE ATT&CK techniques like T1078 (Valid Accounts).

---

## 3. Incident Escalation Workflows
- Learned how SOC teams are structured into Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3.
- Understood when and why incidents should be escalated.
- Learned the importance of clear communication during incident escalation.
- Gained awareness of SITREP reports and their role in incident handling.
- Learned how SOAR tools help automate escalation and response tasks.

---

## Overall Learning
- Understood how logs, threat intelligence, and escalation workflows work together in a SOC.
- Gained clarity on how theoretical concepts support real-world security monitoring.
